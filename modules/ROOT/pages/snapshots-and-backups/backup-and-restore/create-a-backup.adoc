== Incremental Backup

Backups in Longhorn are objects in an off-cluster backupstore. A backup of a snapshot is copied to the backupstore, and the endpoint to access the backupstore is the backup target. For more information, see xref:concepts.adoc#31-how-backups-work[this section.]

____
*Prerequisite:* A backup target must be set up. For more information, see xref:snapshots-and-backups/backup-and-restore/set-backup-target.adoc[Set the BackupTarget]. If the BackupTarget has not been set, you'll be presented with an error.

=== Create an Incremental Backup Using UI

To create a backup,

. Navigate to the *Volume* menu.
. Select the volume you wish to back up.
. Click *Create Backup.*
. Add any appropriate labels and click OK.

*Result:* The backup is created. To see it, click *Backup* in the top navigation bar.

For information about restoring a volume from a snapshot, see xref:snapshots-and-backups/backup-and-restore/restore-from-a-backup.adoc[Restore from a Backup].

=== Create an Incremental Using YAML Code

. Obtain the name of the snapshot that you want to back up (from either the Longhorn UI or the CR).
. Apply the YAML.

Example:

[subs="+attributes",yaml]
----
apiVersion: longhorn.io/v1beta2
kind: Backup
metadata:
  name: backup-example
  namespace: longhorn-system
spec:
  backupMode: incremental
  snapshotName: snapshot-name-example
  labels:
    app: test
----

== Full Backup

By default, Longhorn backs up only data that was changed since the last backup. This approach, known as _delta backup_, enhances time efficiency and conserves network throughput. However, when a data block in the backupstore becomes corrupted, Longhorn does not replace that data block with a healthy one during subsequent backup operations.

Starting with v1.7.0, Longhorn can perform full backups that upload all data blocks in the volume and overwrite existing data blocks in the backupstore.

=== Create a Full Backup Using the Longhorn UI

. Go to the *Volume* screen.
. Select the volume that you want to back up.
. Click *Create Backup*.
. Add appropriate labels.
. Select Full Backup.
. Click *OK*.

== Uploaded Data Size

To facilitate collection of data transfer information for each backup, Longhorn records the information using two metrics in the CR status.

=== Newly Uploaded Data Size

`status.newlyUploadDataSize` records the size of data that was uploaded _for the first time_ to the backupstore during the latest backup. In other words, it tracks the size of data blocks that did not previously exist in the backupstore.

=== Re-Uploaded Data Size

`status.reUploadDataSize` records the size of data that was overwritten during the latest full backup. In other words, it tracks the size of data blocks that previously existed in the backupstore.
