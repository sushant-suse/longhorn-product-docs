A xref:concepts.adoc#24-snapshots[snapshot] is the state of a Kubernetes Volume at any given point in time.

To create a snapshot of an existing cluster,

. In the top navigation bar of the Longhorn UI, click *Volume.*
. Click the name of the volume of which you want a snapshot. This leads to the volume detail page.
. Click the *Take Snapshot* button

Once the snapshot is created you'll see it in the list of snapshots for the volume prior to the Volume Head.
