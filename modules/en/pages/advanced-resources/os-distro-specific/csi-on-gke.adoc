= Longhorn CSI on GKE
:weight: 3
:current-version: {page-origin-branch}

To operate Longhorn on a cluster provisioned with Google Kubernetes Engine, some additional configuration is required.

. GKE clusters must use the `Ubuntu` OS instead of `Container-Optimized` OS, in order to satisfy Longhorn's `open-iscsi` dependency.
. GKE requires a user to manually claim themselves as cluster admin to enable role-based access control. Before installing Longhorn, run the following command:
+
[subs="+attributes",shell]
----
 kubectl create clusterrolebinding cluster-admin-binding --clusterrole=cluster-admin --user=<name@example.com>
----
+
where `name@example.com` is the user's account name in GCE.  It's case sensitive. See https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/role-based-access-control[this document] for more information.
