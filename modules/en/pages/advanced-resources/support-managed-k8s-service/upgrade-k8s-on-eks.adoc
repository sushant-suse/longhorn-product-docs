:current-version: {page-origin-branch}

In Longhorn, set `replica-replenishment-wait-interval` to `0`.

See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/update-cluster.html[Updating a cluster] for instructions.

NOTE: If you have created xref:advanced-resources/support-managed-k8s-service/manage-node-group-on-eks.adoc#create-additional-volume[addition disks] for Longhorn, you will need to manually add the path of the mounted disk into the disk list of the upgraded nodes.
