[[attachreattach]]
== Attach/Reattach

To attach a block device is to make it appear on the Linux node (for example, `/dev/longhorn/testvol`).
If the volume engine dies unexpectedly, {longhorn-product-name} automatically reattaches the volume.

[[backup]]
== Backup

A backup is an object stored in the backupstore. The backupstore may contain both volume backups and system backups.

[[backupstore]]
== Backupstore

The backupstore is the external storage location where {longhorn-product-name} backups are saved.
It can be either an NFS share, CIFS share, or an S3-compatible object store.
{longhorn-product-name} connects to a backupstore through a configured backup target.

[[backup-target]]
== Backup Target

A backup target is the endpoint used to access a backupstore in {longhorn-product-name}.

[[backup-volume]]
== Backup Volume

A backup volume represents all backups associated with a single original Longhorn volume.
It is stored in the backupstore and visible on the *Backup* page of the {longhorn-product-name} UI.

Backup volumes contain multiple backups for the same volume.
Backups are created from snapshots and capture the state of the volume at the time the snapshot was taken.
They do not include the snapshot chain or history of changes.

Backups are stored as 2 MiB blocks in object storage by default.

For more details on how snapshots and backups work, see the concepts documentation - xref:introduction/concepts.adoc#_3_1_how_backups_work[How Backups Work].

[[block-storage]]
== Block Storage

A storage approach in which data is stored in fixed-size blocks, each identified by a memory address.

[[block-type-disks]]
== Block-Type Disks

A block-type disk is an unformatted block device that {longhorn-product-name} uses directly for V2 Data Engine volumes.

[[crd]]
== CRD

A Kubernetes https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/[custom resource definition].

[[cross-cluster-disaster-recovery]]
== Cross-Cluster Disaster Recovery

Cross-cluster disaster recovery allows data from a primary Kubernetes cluster to be recovered on a separate cluster using backups.

[[csi-driver]]
== CSI Driver

The Longhorn CSI Driver is a https://kubernetes-csi.github.io/docs/drivers.html[container storage interface] that can be used with Kubernetes.
The CSI driver for Longhorn volumes is named `driver.longhorn.io`.

[[disaster-recovery-volumes-dr-volume]]
== Disaster Recovery Volumes (DR volume)

A DR volume is a special volume used to maintain a copy of data in a backup cluster so the workload can recover if the primary cluster becomes unavailable.
DR volumes are used to increase the resiliency of Longhorn volumes.

Each backup volume in the backupstore corresponds to one original volume, and each DR volume corresponds to a backup volume.

DR volumes can be created to accurately reflect backups of a Longhorn volume but cannot function as normal Longhorn volumes until they are activated.

[[ext4]]
== Ext4

A Linux filesystem supported by {longhorn-product-name} for storage.

[[filesystem-type-disks]]
== Filesystem-Type Disks

A filesystem-type disk is a block device formatted with an extent-based filesystem (such as `ext4` or XFS).
{longhorn-product-name} mounts it and stores V1 Data Engine replica data.

[[frontend]]
== Frontend

Frontend refers to a block device exposed by a Longhorn volume.

[[instance-manager]]
== Instance Manager

The {longhorn-product-name} component responsible for managing the lifecycle of engine and replica instances.

[[longhorn-engine]]
== Longhorn Engine

A Longhorn Engine is a data plane component of {longhorn-product-name}.
It is a per-volume storage controller responsible for synchronously replicating data to the volume replicas.

[[longhorn-manager]]
== Longhorn Manager

The Longhorn Manager is the control plane component of {longhorn-product-name}.
It runs as a Kubernetes DaemonSet and is responsible for managing volumes, handling API requests, and orchestrating Longhorn Engines, Replicas, and other custom resources.

[[longhorn-volume]]
== Longhorn Volume

A Longhorn volume is a Kubernetes volume managed and replicated by {longhorn-product-name}.

For each volume, Longhorn Manager creates:

* a Longhorn Engine instance
* multiple replicas, each containing a snapshot chain representing the volume history

By default, three replicas are created and distributed across different nodes to ensure high availability.

[[maintenance-mode]]
== Maintenance Mode

A volume attachment mode that attaches the volume without enabling the frontend, primarily used to revert a volume from a snapshot.

[[mount]]
== Mount

A Linux command used to attach a block device to a directory on the node (for example, `mount /dev/longhorn/testvol/mnt`).

[[nfs]]
== NFS

A https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_File_System[distributed filesystem protocol] that provides network-based file access.

{longhorn-product-name} supports using NFS in the following cases:

* As a backupstore for secondary storage.
* As the underlying filesystem for RWX volumes.

[[object-storage]]
== Object Storage

A data storage architecture that manages data as objects, each containing the data, a variable amount of metadata, and a globally unique identifier.
{longhorn-product-name} supports backing up volumes to S3-compatible object stores.

[[offline-expansion]]
== Offline Expansion

A volume expansion performed while the volume is detached.

[[overprovisioning]]
== Overprovisioning

Overprovisioning allows more logical storage to be allocated than the physical capacity available.

For example, a node with 200 GiB of disk space (with 50 GiB reserved for the operating system) could provision 750 GiB of Longhorn volumes.

The *Storage Over Provisioning Percentage* is configurable in the {longhorn-product-name} settings. See xref:longhorn-system/settings.adoc[Settings] for more details.

[[persistentvolume]]
== PersistentVolume

A PersistentVolume (PV) is a Kubernetes resource that represents a piece of storage in the cluster.
It may be provisioned manually or dynamically using StorageClasses.

It is a cluster-level resource and is required for pods to use persistent storage that is independent of the pod lifecycle.

For more information, see the Kubernetes documentation on https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/[persistent volumes].

[[persistentvolumeclaim]]
== PersistentVolumeClaim

A PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) is a user request for storage.
Claims specify the desired size and access modes (for example, ReadWriteOnce or ReadOnlyMany).

Pods use PVCs to obtain persistent storage.

See the official Kubernetes documentation at https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/[persistent volumes].

[[primary-backups]]
== Primary Backups

The replicas of a Longhorn volume within the Kubernetes cluster can be considered primary backups.

[[read-index]]
== Read Index

The read index is an in-memory data structure used by each replica to improve read performance.
It records which differencing disk (snapshot) contains the valid data for each 4K block.

[[recurring-snapshots]]
== Recurring Snapshots

Recurring snapshots allow {longhorn-product-name} to automatically create and retain snapshots at a specified frequency (for example, hourly or daily).

[[remount]]
== Remount

After reattachment, {longhorn-product-name} automatically detects and mounts the filesystem of the volume.

[[replica]]
== Replica

A replica is a Longhorn volume data store that consists of a history of the changes in the data within a volume.

[[s3]]
== S3

https://aws.amazon.com/s3/[Amazon S3] is an object storage service.

[[salvage-a-volume]]
== Salvage a Volume

A salvage operation is required when all replicas become faulty (for example, due to network disconnection).
During salvage, {longhorn-product-name} tries to identify any usable replicas and then uses them to recover the volume.

[[secondary-backups]]
== Secondary Backups

Backups stored external to the Kubernetes cluster, on S3, NFS, or CIFS.

[[smbcifs]]
== SMB/CIFS

A https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Message_Block[network file-sharing protocol] that provides remote file access similar to local storage.
{longhorn-product-name} supports using SMB/CIFS as a backupstore for secondary storage.

[[snapshot]]
== Snapshot

A snapshot captures the state of a volume at the time the snapshot is created.
Each snapshot stores only the changes that overwrite earlier data, so a chain of snapshots is required to represent the full state.

Volumes can be restored from snapshots.

See the concepts documentation - xref:introduction/concepts.adoc#_2_4_1_how_snapshots_work[How Snapshots Work].

[[snapshot-data-integrity]]
== Snapshot Data Integrity

Snapshot Data Integrity is a {longhorn-product-name} feature that hashes snapshot disk files and periodically checks their integrity to detect filesystem-unaware corruption, such as bit rot.

[[stable-identity]]
== Stable Identity

https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/[StatefulSets] have a stable identity, meaning Kubernetes does not force-delete the Pod.

[[statefulset]]
== StatefulSet

A https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/[Kubernetes resource] used for managing stateful applications.

[[storageclass]]
== StorageClass

A https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/storage-classes/#the-storageclass-resource[Kubernetes resource] used to automatically provision PersistentVolumes for pods.

[[system-backup]]
== System Backup

A system backup contains a bundle of Longhorn system resources and is stored in the backupstore.

See the Longhorn xref:snapshots-backups/system-backups/create-system-backup.adoc[System Backup Bundle documentation] for more details on the resources included in a system backup.

[[thin-provisioning]]
== Thin Provisioning

{longhorn-product-name} is a thin-provisioned storage system. {longhorn-product-name} volume uses only the space required at a given time.

For example, a 20 GiB volume that stores 1 GiB of data uses only 1 GiB of disk space.

[[umount]]
== Umount

A https://linux.die.net/man/8/umount[Linux command] that detaches a filesystem from the file hierarchy.

[[v1-data-engine]]
== V1 Data Engine

The V1 Data Engine is the original data plane component of {longhorn-product-name}.
It uses host filesystem sparse files for thin provisioning, with volumes composed of replicas, supporting snapshots and backups.

[[v2-data-engine]]
== V2 Data Engine

The V2 Data Engine is the Longhorn data plane.
It uses SPDK and huge pages, and block devices to provide higher performance.

[[volumes-kubernetes-concept]]
== Volumes (Kubernetes Concept)

A Kubernetes volume allows a pod to store files during its lifetime.
These files persist across container restarts but not when the pod is deleted.

To preserve storage beyond the pod lifecycle, a https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#persistent-volumes[PersistentVolume] is required.

See the Kubernetes documentation at https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/[Volumes] for more details.

[[xfs]]
== XFS

A https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XFS[filesystem] supported by most Linux distributions.
{longhorn-product-name} supports XFS for storage.
