= Access the User Interface

Exposing the {longhorn-product-name} UI allows external access to the management console. The choice of Ingress controller (for example, *ingress-nginx*, *Traefik*, or *HAProxy*) affects only how the UI is accessed. It has *no impact on the Longhorn backend, storage operations, or data integrity*.

[NOTE]
====
As of November 2025, the Kubernetes project has announced the retirement of the ingress-nginx controller. For details, see https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/11/11/ingress-nginx-retirement/[the official announcement].

== Prerequisites for Access and Authentication

These instructions assume that {longhorn-product-name} is already installed in the cluster.

If you installed {longhorn-product-name} using the YAML manifest, you must set up an Ingress controller to allow external traffic into the cluster. Authentication is *not enabled by default*. This applies to both Helm and `kubectl` installations.

For information on creating an NGINX Ingress controller with basic authentication, see xref:longhorn-system/system-access/create-ingress.adoc[this section]. Alternatively, you can use the xref:longhorn-system/system-access/longhorn-httproute.adoc[Gateway API HTTPRoute] as a modern approach to exposing the {longhorn-product-name} UI.

If {longhorn-product-name} was installed as a Rancher catalog app, Rancher automatically creates an Ingress controller with access control (the `rancher-proxy`).

== Accessing the {longhorn-product-name} UI

After {longhorn-product-name} is installed in your Kubernetes cluster, you can access the UI dashboard by following these steps.

. Retrieve the {longhorn-product-name} service information:
+
[,shell]
----
kubectl -n longhorn-system get svc
----
+
For {longhorn-product-name} v0.8.0 and later, the output resembles the following. Use the `CLUSTER-IP` of the `longhorn-frontend` service to access the UI:
+
[,shell]
----
NAME                TYPE        CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE
longhorn-backend    ClusterIP   10.20.248.250   <none>        9500/TCP   58m
longhorn-frontend   ClusterIP   10.20.245.110   <none>        80/TCP     58m
----
+
In this example, the UI is accessible at `10.20.245.110`.
+
[NOTE]
====
Starting with {longhorn-product-name} v0.8.0, the UI service type changed from `LoadBalancer` to `ClusterIP`.
====

. Open a browser and navigate to the IP address of the `longhorn-frontend` service.
+
The {longhorn-product-name} UI appears as follows:
