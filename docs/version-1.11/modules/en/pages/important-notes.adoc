== Behavior Change

=== Cloned Volume Health After Efficient Cloning

With efficient cloning enabled, a newly cloned and detached volume is degraded and has only one replica, with its clone status set to `copy-completed-awaiting-healthy`. To bring the volume to a healthy state, transition the clone status to `completed` and rebuild the remaining replica by either enabling offline replica rebuilding or attaching the volume to trigger replica rebuilding. See https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/12341[Issue #12341] and https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/12328[Issue #12328].

== Removal

=== `longhorn.io/v1beta1` API

The `v1beta1` Longhorn API version was removed in {longhorn-product-name} v1.10.0.

For more details, see link:https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/10249[Issue #10249].

=== `replica.status.evictionRequested` field

The deprecated `replica.status.evictionRequested` field has been removed.

For more details, see https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/7022[Issue #7022].

== General

=== Kubernetes Version Requirement

Due to the upgrade of the CSI external snapshotter to v8.2.0, you must be running Kubernetes v1.25 or later to upgrade to {longhorn-product-name}  v1.8.0 or a newer version.

=== CRD Upgrade Validation

During an upgrade, a new Longhorn manager might start before the Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) are applied. This sequence ensures the controller does not process objects with deprecated data or fields. However, if the CRD has not yet been applied, the Longhorn manager can fail during the initial upgrade phase.

If the Longhorn Manager crashes during the upgrade, check the logs to determine if the CRD not being applied is the cause of the failure. In such cases, the logs might contain error messages similar to the following:

[,log]
----
time="2025-03-27T06:59:55Z" level=fatal msg="Error starting manager: upgrade resources failed: BackingImage in version \"v1beta2\" cannot be handled as a BackingImage: strict decoding error: unknown field \"spec.diskFileSpecMap\", unknown field \"spec.diskSelector\", unknown field \"spec.minNumberOfCopies\", unknown field \"spec.nodeSelector\", unknown field \"spec.secret\", unknown field \"spec.secretNamespace\"" func=main.main.DaemonCmd.func3 file="daemon.go:94"
----

=== Upgrade Check Events

When you upgrade with Helm or the Rancher App Marketplace, {longhorn-product-name} performs pre-upgrade checks. If a check fails, the upgrade stops and the reason for the failure is recorded in an event.

For more details, see xref:upgrades/longhorn-components/upgrade-longhorn-manager.adoc[Upgrading Longhorn Manager].

=== Manual Checks Before Upgrade

Automated pre-upgrade checks does not cover all scenarios. A manual check is recommended using `kubectl` or the {longhorn-product-name} UI.

* Ensure all V2 Data Engine volumes are detached and replicas are stopped. The V2 engine does not support live upgrades.
* Avoid upgrading when volumes are Faulted. Unusable replicas may be deleted, causing permanent data loss if no backups exist.
* Avoid upgrading if a failed `BackingImage` exists. For more information, see xref:volumes/backing-images/backing-images.adoc[Backing Image] for details.
* Create a xref:snapshots-backups/system-backups/create-system-backup.adoc[Longhorn System Backup] upgrading is recommended to ensure recoverability.

=== Consolidated {longhorn-product-name} Settings

Settings have been consolidated for easier management across V1 and V2 Data Engines. Each setting now uses one of these formats:

* Single value for all supported data engines:
** *Format*: Non-JSON string (for example, `1024`)
** This value applies to all supported data engines and must be the same across them. Data engine-specific values are not allowed.
* Data engine-specific values for V1 and V2 data engines:
** *Format*: JSON object (for example, `{"v1": "value1", "v2": "value2"}`)
** This allows you to specify different values for the V1 and V2 data engines.
* Data engine-specific values for V1 data engine only:
** *Format*: JSON object with a `v1` key only (for example, `{"v1": "value1"}`)
** This allows you to configure only the V1 data engine, and it does not affect the V2 data engine.
* Data engine-specific values for V2 data engine only:
** *Format*: JSON object with a `v2` key only (for example, `{"v2": "value1"}`)
** This allows you to configure only the V2 data engine, and it does not affect the V1 data engine.

For more information, see the xref:longhorn-system/settings.adoc[{longhorn-product-name} Settings].

=== System Info Category in Setting

A new *System Info* category has been added to show cluster-level information more clearly.

For more details, see https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/11656[Issue #11656].

==== Configurable Backup Block Size

The {longhorn-product-name} UI now display a summary of attachment tickets on each volume overview page for improved visibility into volume state.

For more details, see https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/11400[Issue #11400] and https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/11401[Issue #11400].

== Scheduling

=== Pod Scheduling with CSIStorageCapacity

{longhorn-product-name} now supports Kubernetes *CSIStorageCapacity*, which enables the scheduler to verify node storage before it schedules pods that use StorageClasses with *WaitForFirstConsumer*. This reduces scheduling errors and improves reliability.

For more details, see https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/10685[Issue #10685].

== Performance

=== Configurable Backup Block Size

Backup block size can now be configured when you create a volume, starting in {longhorn-product-name} v1.10.0. This allows you to optimize for performance, efficiency, and cost.

For more information, see xref:volumes/create-volumes.adoc[Create Longhorn Volumes].

=== Profiling Support for Backup Sync Agent

The backup sync agent has a `pprof` server for profiling runtime resource usage during backup sync operations.

For more information, see xref:troubleshooting-maintenance/troubleshooting.adoc#_profiling[Profiling].

== Resilience

=== Configurable Liveness Probe for Instance Manager

You can now configure the instance-manager pod liveness probes. This allows the system to better distinguish between temporary delays and actual failures, which helps reduce unnecessary restarts and improves overall cluster stability.

For more information, see xref:longhorn-system/settings.adoc#_instance_manager_pod_liveness_probe_timeout[{longhorn-product-name} Settings].

=== Backing Image Manager CR Naming

Backing Image Manager CRs now use a compact, collision-resistant naming format to reduce the risk of conflicts.

For more details, see https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/11455[Issue #11455].

== Monitoring

=== Disk health monitoring

Starting with {longhorn-product-name} v1.11.0, disk health monitoring is available for both the V1 and V2 data engines. {longhorn-product-name} collects disk health data and exposes it through Prometheus metrics and the `Node` custom resources.

.Key features
* Automatic health data collection every 10 minutes.
* Disk health status and detailed attributes exposed as Prometheus metrics.
* Health data available in the `nodes.longhorn.io` custom resources.

[NOTE]
====
* SMART data may not be fully available in virtualized or cloud environments (for example, AWS EBS). This can result in zero values for some attributes.
* Available health attributes vary depending on disk type and hardware.
====

For more information, see:  
xref:observability/disk-health.adoc[Disk health monitoring].

== Security

=== Refined RBAC Permissions

RBAC permissions have been refined to minimize privileges and improve cluster security.

For more details, see https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/11345[Issue #11345].

== V1 Data Engine

=== IPv6 Support

V1 volumes now support single-stack IPv6 Kubernetes clusters.

[WARNING]
====
Dual-stack Kubernetes clusters and V2 volumes are not supported in this release.
====

For more details, see https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/2259[Issue #2259].

== V2 Data Engine

=== {longhorn-product-name} System Upgrade

Live upgrades of V2 volumes are not supported. Before you upgrade, make sure all V2 volumes are detached.

=== New Introduced Functionalities since {longhorn-product-name} v1.10.0

====  V2 Data Engine Without Hugepage Support

The V2 Data Engine can run without Hugepages by setting `data-engine-hugepage-enabled`` to `{"v2":"false"}``. This reduces memory pressure on low-spec nodes and increases deployment flexibility. The performance may be lower compared to running with Hugepage.

==== V2 Data Engine Interrupt Mode Support

Interrupt mode has been added to the V2 Data Engine to help reduce CPU usage. This feature is especially beneficial for clusters with idle or low I/O workloads, where conserving CPU resources is more important than minimizing latency.

While interrupt mode lowers CPU consumption, it may introduce slightly higher I/O latency compared to polling mode. Also, the current implementation uses a hybrid approach, which still incurs a minimal, constant CPU load even when interrupts are enabled.

For more information, see xref:longhorn-system/v2-data-engine/features/interrupt-mode.adoc[Interrupt Mode].

[NOTE]
====
In {longhorn-product-name} v1.10.0, interrupt mode supports only *AIO disks*. Interrupt mode for *NVMe disks* is supported starting in v1.10.1.
====

==== V2 Data Engine Volume Clone Support

{longhorn-product-name} now supports volume and snapshot cloning for V2 data engine volumes.

For more information, see xref:longhorn-system/v2-data-engine/features/volume-clone.adoc[Volume Clone Support].

==== V2 Data Engine Replica Rebuild QoS

Provides Quality of Service (QoS) control for V2 volume replica rebuilds. You can configure bandwidth limits globally or per volume to prevent storage throughput overload on source and destination nodes.

For more information, see xref:longhorn-system/v2-data-engine/features/replica-rebuild-qos.adoc[Replica Rebuild QoS].

==== V2 Data Engine Volume Expansion

{longhorn-product-name} now supports volume expansion for V2 Data Engine volumes. Users can expand the volume through the UI or by modifying the PVC manifest.

For more information, see xref:longhorn-system/v2-data-engine/features/volume-expansion.adoc[V2 Volume Expansion].
