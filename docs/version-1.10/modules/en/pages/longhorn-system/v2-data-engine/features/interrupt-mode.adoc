Starting with v1.10.0, {longhorn-product-name} supports *SPDK interrupt mode* for V2 data engine volumes. Interrupt mode provides an alternative to the default *polling mode*, offering improved CPU efficiency in certain environments.

Interrupt mode is particularly suitable for clusters with limited CPU resources and a relatively small number of volumes. While polling mode maximizes performance by keeping CPU utilization close to 100% on allocated cores, interrupt mode reduces CPU usage by allowing the SPDK reactor to adjust its usage dynamically instead of continuously polling.

== Overview

=== Polling mode vs. Interrupt mode

* *Polling Mode (Default)*:
** It continuously polls for I/O operations.
** It provides the lowest latency.
** It consumes ~100% of the allocated CPU core at all times.
** It is best suited for high-performance workloads with frequent I/O.
* *Interrupt Mode*:
** It uses interrupt-driven I/O handling.
** CPU consumption scales with the number of attached volumes.
** It is better suited for resource-constrained environments.

== Prerequisites

* {longhorn-product-name} v1.10.0 or later
* V2 data engine enabled
* No attached v2 volumes when changing the setting

== Configuration

=== Global setting

To enable interrupt mode globally, update the xref:longhorn-system/settings.adoc#_data_engine_interrupt_mode_enabled[data-engine-interrupt-mode-enabled] setting.

=== Important considerations

* *Volume State Requirement*: The setting can only be changed when no V2 volumes are attached. {longhorn-product-name} blocks updates if any V2 volume is active.
* *Global Effect*: The setting applies to all V2 volumes.

== Performance characteristics

=== Recommended use cases

Enable interrupt mode for these cases:

* You are running in resource-constrained clusters.
* You are managing a small number of volumes.
* CPU resources are limited or shared with other workloads.
* I/O patterns are sporadic rather than continuous.
* Energy efficiency is a priority.

== Limitations

=== Hybrid implementation

The current V2 volume interrupt mode uses a hybrid approach for NVMe/TCP transport:

* *Admin Queue Operations*: It still relies on periodic polling for keepalive and controller recovery.
* *I/O Queue Completion*: It uses polling for command completion.
* *Residual CPU Usage*: It results in a small but constant CPU load, even when attached volumes are idle.

=== Performance trade-offs

* *Latency*: It is slightly higher than polling mode.

=== Operational Restrictions

* *Setting Changes*: It cannot be modified while V2 volumes are attached.
* *Global Scope*: It applies globally; no per-volume override is available.

=== Disk Support

* Interrupt mode currently supports AIO disks only.
