= Upgrade Longhorn Manager
:revdate: 2026-01-22
:page-revdate: {revdate}
:current-version: {page-component-version}

[WARNING]
====
It is recommended to create a xref:snapshots-backups/system-backups/create-system-backup.adoc[Longhorn system backup] before performing the upgrade. This ensures that all critical resources, such as volumes and backing images, are backed up and can be restored in case any issues arise.
====

== Upgrading from v1.9.x

{longhorn-product-name} only supports upgrading to v{current-version} from v1.9.x. For other versions, please upgrade to v1.9.x first.

For airgap upgrades when {longhorn-product-name} is installed as a Rancher app, you will need to modify the image names and remove the registry URL part.

For air-gapped upgrades when {longhorn-product-name} is installed as a Rancher app, you will need to modify the image names and remove the registry URL part. For example, the image `registry.example.com/longhorn/longhorn-manager:v{patch-version}` is changed to `longhorn/longhorn-manager:v{patch-version}` in Longhorn images section. For more information, see the air gap installation steps xref:installation-setup/installation/airgapped-environment.adoc#_using_a_rancher_app[here].

=== Preparing for the Upgrade

The current default StorageClass has the following parameters:

[,yaml]
----
parameters:
  numberOfReplicas: <user specified replica count, 3 by default>
  staleReplicaTimeout: "30"
  fromBackup: ""
  baseImage: ""
----

== Upgrade

[IMPORTANT]
====
Always back up volumes before upgrading. If anything goes wrong, you can restore the volume using the backup.

=== Upgrade Using the {rancher-product-name} UI

For Kubernetes clusters managed by {rancher-product-name}, you can upgrade the {longhorn-product-name} App by updating the repository to reference a newer Helm chart version. 

The following procedure describes how to upgrade the {longhorn-product-name} App on {rancher-product-name}.

. Go to *Apps > Repositories*.
. Click *Create*.
. Select *OCI Repository* as the target.
. Provide a name for the repository, for example, `suse-storage`.
. In the *OCI Repository Host URL* field, enter:
+
`oci://dp.apps.rancher.io/charts/suse-storage`
+
image::screenshots/install/add-repo.png[Add Repository, width=100%]

. Click *Create* button.
. Verify that the repository has been added successfully.
+
image::screenshots/install/add-repo-success.png[Repository Added, width=100%]

. Go to *Apps > Charts* and find the `suse-storage` chart.
+
image::screenshots/install/find-chart.png[Find Chart, width=100%]

. Click the chart, and then click *Install*.
+
image::screenshots/install/install-chart.png[Install Chart, width=100%]

. On the next page, set `global.imagePullSecrets` to `application-collection`, and then click *Install*.

=== Upgrade with Helm

Upgrading the {longhorn-product-name} Helm chart involves updating your deployment to a newer version or switching between Longhorn community images and {longhorn-product-name} images.

The general Helm command for upgrading is:

[subs="+attributes",shell]
----
helm upgrade longhorn oci://dp.apps.rancher.io/charts/suse-storage \
  --namespace longhorn-system \
  --version <version> \ # Replace with the version you would like to upgrade to
  --set global.imagePullSecrets=<PULL_IMAGE_SECRET> \
  -f values.yaml
----

[NOTE]
====
To create a secret, follow the https://docs.apps.rancher.io/get-started/authentication/#kubernetes[AppCo documentation].
====

Or, if upgrading without a specific `values.yaml` file and only changing the version:

[subs="+attributes",shell]
----
helm upgrade longhorn oci://dp.apps.rancher.io/charts/suse-storage \
  --namespace longhorn-system \
  --version <version> \ # Replace with the version you would like to upgrade to
  --set global.imagePullSecrets=<PULL_IMAGE_SECRET>
----

* *Upgrade Path*: Refer to the official xref:upgrades/upgrades.adoc[{longhorn-product-name} upgrade documentation] for specific version-to-version upgrade paths, prerequisites, and post-upgrade verification steps. This is important to ensure a smooth upgrade and data integrity.
* *Configuration Changes*: If you have custom configurations, ensure you carry them over to the new chart version, merging with any default changes.

=== Upgrade with Fleet

Update the value of `helm.version` in the `fleet` YAML file of your GitOps repository.

[subs="+attributes",yaml]
----
helm:
  repo: https://charts.longhorn.io
  chart: longhorn
  version: v{patch-version} # Replace with the {longhorn-product-name} version you would like to upgrade to
  releaseName: longhorn
----

=== Upgrade with Flux

Update the value of `spec.chart.spec.version` in the `HelmRelease` YAML file of your GitOps repository.

[subs="+attributes",yaml]
----
spec:
  chart:
    spec:
      chart: longhorn
      reconcileStrategy: ChartVersion
      sourceRef:
        kind: HelmRepository
        name: longhorn
      version: v{patch-version} # Replace with the {longhorn-product-name} version you would like to upgrade to
----

=== Upgrade with Argo CD

Update the value of `targetRevision` in the `Application` YAML file of your GitOps repository.

[subs="+attributes",yaml]
----
spec:
  project: default
  sources:
    - chart: longhorn
      repoURL: https://charts.longhorn.io
      targetRevision: v{patch-version} # Replace with the {longhorn-product-name} version you would like to upgrade to
----

Then wait for all the pods to become running and {longhorn-product-name} UI working. For example:

[,shell]
----
$ kubectl -n longhorn-system get pod
NAME                                                  READY   STATUS    RESTARTS      AGE
